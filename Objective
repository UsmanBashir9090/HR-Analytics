Background:
You belong to a startup called ABDATA that is looking at conducting various data analysis projects. One
of these working collaboratively with the HR department of a consulting firm in determining which
factors contribute to an employee turning to look for new roles/jobs.

Objective: Explore and analyze the factors that lead to employee turnover. Rationalize your findings
with potential explanations as to why an employee would leave using data driven insights and rank
which factors contribute the most or are most important. Recommend ways this can be reduced, and
employee satisfaction and commitment can be increased (this should not conflict with your data
findings)
